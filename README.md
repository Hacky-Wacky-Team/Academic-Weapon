## What it does 📖
The Academic Weapon bot aims to support and help students with their academics and organize their lives. It can create reminders, to-do lists, timetables, calculate your average grade, list study resources, and more.

## How we built it ⚙️
We used the website Replit to code and host the discord bot in Python together using its real-time collaboration feature. This was also created within 36 hours.

## Inspiration ✨
Inspired by other apps and programs online that help students with studying. We instantly thought that Discord users would need something as well to do all their studying within Discord.

## Our Future 🚀
We plan to add more features in the future such as flashcards/create your own quiz to help with studying and a study music feature where it can recommend playlists and join voice channels and play music.
