## Inspiration
Inspired by other apps and programs online that help students with studying. We instantly thought that Discord users would need something as well to do all their studying within Discord.

## What it does
The Academic Weapon bot aims to support and help students with their academics and organize their lives. It can create reminders, to-do lists, timetables, calculate your average grade, list study resources and many other academic tools.

## How we built it
We used the website Replit to code and host the discord bot in Python together using its real-time collaboration feature. We also used many resources online like documentation and videos and applied that knowledge to our code.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we faced was working with select menus in Discord. We tried using the select menus for the to-do list but were met with many errors. Instead, we changed the to-do list into an embed and added individual slash commands to interact with the to-do list such as adding and removing tasks. Doing this allowed the code to run without errors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to create a functioning bot in such a short period of time for our very first hackathon.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about building discord bots such as how to create select menus, buttons, slash commands, and embeds that can be sent by the bot. We also realized that we should have been more organized in managing our work and our time.

## What's next for Academic Weapon
We plan to add more features in the future such as flashcards/create your own quiz to help with studying and a study music feature where it can recommend playlists and join voice channels and play music for you.
